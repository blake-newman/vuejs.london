              We've heard that animating our web interfaces can improve user experience and even
              boost conversions, but what exactly should we be animating, and how?

              This talk walks through using Vue.js to build several practical animations any web app

              Built-in CSS Modules and Scoped CSS support eases the process of styling your Vue. But
              a separate &lt;style&gt; tag is still needed. What about styling directly and
              dynamically in JavaScript - aka CSS-in-JS and save the pain?

              In mobile-first era performance has never been more important yet a lot of websites
              struggle with many issues in this area. During the talk, after short theoretical
              introduction Iâ€™ll dig into a live coding session on a real-world Vue application that
              suffers from performance issues.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>
              I will show how to solve them on stage while introducing proper usage of lazy loading
              for routes, libs and components along with proper caching strategies.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>
              I will also show tools that could identify performance issues and suggest proper way
              of solving them like Webpack Bundle Analyzer or Bundlephobia.

            <paragraph>
              D3 is the best choice when you want to create complex and interactive data
              visualisation for the web. D3 works directly with the DOM. In contrast, Vue works with
              a virtual DOM.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>
              How can you make the two have a great friendship and not fight over DOM manipulation?
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>
              I will cover this in my talk and also tips on how to build scalable data visualisation
              components, when is a good idea to use D3 and methods on how to make it less
              intimidating when combined with Vue. I will show examples from simple D3
              visualisations to more complex ones

              TypeScript offers a lot of benefits over JavaScript such as type safety and better
              auto-completion in editors, but these benefits do not directly trickle down to Vue. In
              this talk, I trace through improvements in the Vue Language Server that enables type
              safety of Vue Single File Components, and what that entails for writing type-safe Vue
              code.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>
              I will talk about innovations in Vue Language Server that could improve Vue
              developer's productivity. Finally, we will examine how we can leverage types to build
              a better ecosystem of Vue components.

              Vue official router has been a pleasure to build apps with but as the community grows,
              so do the router needs. However, it hasn't kept up as good as I wish it had with all
              the good proposals out there. As a result, we have also taken more time to work on the
              new version of Vue router and shaping an API that will serve Vue 2 and Vue 3. A more
              extensible router, easier to contribute and new architecture from scratch. Let's talk
              about what has changed in the new Router and all the improvements we are bringing.

              Vue 3 and a Vue 2 plugin will offer new ways of encapsulating reusable chunks of code
              that offer a lot of advantages over patterns/features like mixins, Wrapper Components
              or Renderless components: composition functions using dynamic lifecycle hooks and the
              new Reactivity API.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>
              In this talk, we will talk about the history of these "other" features, their use
              cases and their use cases and weaknesses, and finally, show how you can solve these
              use cases that the Functional Component Composition API provides, and how that's
              better in a lot of ways: more elegant, more composable, less scattered.
