        Everyone deserves the opportunity to

        It may not always be possible for the company to provide you with a ticket - but there are
        other ways your company may be able to help you. Maybe they can provide you 'paid time' to
        attend the conference - or they can help subsidise costs. It doesn't hurt to compromise and
        discuss.
