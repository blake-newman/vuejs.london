      <paragraph>
        London is one of the biggest tech hubs in the world, with a massive amount of developer
        demand and is home to some of the biggest and best tech companies in the world.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        After learning so much about Vue, why don't you plan a few extra days after the conference
        to explore the view of the city? (Yes that is a pun). Visit the history of London, with some
        of the most iconic landmarks in the world; The shard, Tower Bridge, Big Ben, Buckingham
        Palace, St. Pauls Cathedral, Royal Albert Hall, London Eye and so much more.

          We wanted to make your conference even better, so the venue has to make an impact and
          represent the values of Vue.js.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
          So we picked an iconic venue, built to celebrate the turn of the century, The O2. We chose
          this venue to celebrate the growth, popularity and community of Vue.js. Enjoy a venue with
          tonnes of additional attractions available to you.
