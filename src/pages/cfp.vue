        Anyone is welcome to apply! The prominent theme for this year will be around growth, scale
        and awareness. We will focus on talks and technologies that will share knowledge on scaling
        and growing Vue.js Applications to enterprise quality. Vue 3 will be the core focus of all
        talks, we will work with all accepted speakers to ensure their content is focused for Vue 3.
