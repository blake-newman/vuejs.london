          In this workshop I’ll walk you through some fundamental aspects of designing motion for
          the web. How you can use transitions and animations to improve the user experience and how
          to build Vue components that encapsulate motion for reuse.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
          We’ll explore how to implement advanced page transitions and how we can integrate Vue with
          Canvas, and take advantage of its highly performant API combined with the delightful and
          easy to use Vue syntax.

          This is a half-day workshop in the morning.

        <paragraph>
          Accessibility on the web is increasing in visibility, yet some web creators are still
          unfamiliar with how to create an amazing, accessible user experience. Spoiler alert, it
          starts with design, but what happens after that? In this workshop, I will walk the
          attendees through a site that has multiple violations, and a low score in Lighthouse. I
          will also touch on aXe Core, what it is, and how to use it. After we comb through the
          site, I will introduce easy wins like semantic markup, alt attributes, and ARIA labels to
          remove all violations. You’ll walk away with the knowledge to build your sites with
          accessibility in mind.

          In this workshop, we'll cover everything you need to know to get started building
          world-class Vue applications. Topics will include using Vue CLI to build apps of any
          scale, setting up the most advanced workflows currently possible, how to organize (and
          reorganize) increasingly complex applications, and more.

        <paragraph>
          In Vue.js, it is quite simple to work with components, and share data among them using
          events and props - especially in small to medium projects. When an application starts
          growing, managing components state might become tedious and overwhelming. This is where
          Vuex comes to our rescue.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
          Vuex is a state management pattern and official library for Vue.js applications. It serves
          as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that
          the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
          By the end of the workshop, attendees will be able to develop elegant, debuggable,
          maintainable, and organized applications using a centralized store. No prior experience
          with Vuex is needed.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
          We will answer the common question, “When should I use Vuex?” and work on real-world
          features.

          This workshop will teach you the fundamentals of Vue.js so you can start being productive
          and building apps immediately. With visual animations and analogies that make abstract
          concepts concrete, along with coding challenges that help you learn by doing, you'll have
          a solid foundation of Vue skills by the end of the day. This class will cover any Vue 3
          syntax that is necessary (but for the basics there may not be any).

          Working with Vue is a lot of fun and you can build amazing applications with it. When
          building a full product though, we want to make sure it's all highest quality. Besides
          good development patterns, testing is an incredibly important aspect of the delivery
          process.

          We all want to consistently ship quality software. One of the best ways to do that is by
          end-to-end (E2E) testing our apps to simulate the real actions of our users. However, E2E
          testing in real browsers has notoriously been time-consuming, expensive, slow, and often
          flaky. Unfortunately, these issues lead to developers doing very little to no E2E testing
          and taking solace in a plethora of unit-tests that cannot fully test the intended
          experience of users.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
          In this hands-on session, we’ll dive deep into using Cypress, a developer-friendly
          open-source tool that enables us to easily compose flake-free, reliable, deterministic E2E
          tests for our web applications.
